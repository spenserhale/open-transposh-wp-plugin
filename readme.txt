A Translation Filter Plugin for WordPress offers a unique approach to blog translation. It allows your blog to combine automatic and human translation aided by your users with an easy-to-use in-context interface.

== Description ==
The Open Transposh Plugin is an open-source fork of the Transposh Plugin. The fork\'s existence stemmed from the original Transposh author, who disagreed with security experts and chose not to fix the reported issues. WordPress removed the plugin from their official plugin directory. This plugin resolves the reported issues to allow the WordPress community to continue to use this plugin securely and access to download from the WordPress plugin directory. The plugin is a drop in replacement and uses the same data identifiers for compatibility.
